# leetcode

It seems answering these problems is very important to companies these days.  atoi() has existed in various languages for decades. Now if you can't write the code, it seems to say whether or not you are a decent engineer.  Since this is the first barrier you must pass. Whcih makes it more important than whether or not you can perform well in the postition you are being hired to do.  Can I write do a binary search, parse parentheses, interpret roman numerals.  Which is very important when collecting requirements, presenting plans writing terraform plans, ansible playbooks, chef cookbooks, and python code calling boto.

Well as I submit answers to these very important questions to leetcode and they are accepted, I'll post those solutions here.

I miss the days of silly logic questions and if you had the gall like me you made people answer one if they asked you one.

On your side of a door there are 3 switches connected to 3 bulbs on the other side of the door.  You can open the door once to figure out what switch is connected to what light.  Answer: leave one off.  leave one on, turn on on then off so it will be warm.  I did know a few others at one point.

All this means I am making a job search harder one me.  After all, if you find this before the interview, you know what not to ask. :-D  Otherwise I might not squirm as much.
